Can you line up the perfect spell sequence to produce a powerful Meteor or a deadly Thunderstorm?

Select your favorite class, or try out new ones
In each playthrough you play as a unique class, that has a different set of stats, basic spells, combos and upgrades. Select from various classes such as the powerful Sorcerer or the fiery hybrid warrior Ember Knight.

Engage in action-packed dynamic combat
Combine abilities into powerful attacks - for instance, the Fireball and Shield turns into a Fire Shield, while the Fireball and Arcane Sphere turns into the Fire Globe. Add another Fireball, and you fire off a devastating Meteor:

Explore Margoq's devious lair with endless replayability
Find your way out of a procedurally generated lair filled with deadly traps & horrifying monsters by completing the procedurally generated quests to unlock the door to the next floor. Every floor is randomly cursed by Margoq. This means that each floor is a unique combination of level layout, curse, and quest, ensuring that you never play the same level twice!

Upgrade your character with Blood Perks
Find blood circles that empower your character with procedurally generated Blood Perks, which makes your character powerful, in a unique way in every playthrough.

Find tons of mythical loot to become a powerhouse
Slay monsters, break vases, or find your way to many hidden treasure chests in the depths of the lair, where you can find procedurally generated mythical loot that makes you even more powerful.

Encounter epic boss battles
Throughout the lair, you'll meet difficult boss encounters that need to be defeated before you can continue. All of whom are powerful lieutenants of Margoq, and of course, the demonic wizard himself. They will pose a great challenge for anyone in their path.

Random elite and super elite monsters
It's not just the bigger boss fights that might be difficult for the adventurers. All minions in the lair can be an elite or super elite version of themselves, posing great risks to anyone not giving them the proper respect.

Permadeath and metaprogression power system
Every death in Margoq's Lair is permanent; however, you earn souls during each run which can be used to gain permanent perks and unlock additional content such as new classes, making you progressively more powerful and the gameplay progessively more varied.
